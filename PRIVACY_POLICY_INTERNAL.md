# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2025-08-08

## 1. Introduction
This application is intended to be a private, internal-use tool developed and maintained by our team for organizational purposes. It is not intended for public use or distribution. Access is restricted to authorized team members only.

## 2. Information We Collect
This application may access the following user data through (and not limited to) Google APIs, Zoom, Mattermost, Infisical, etc., depending on the features used:

- Basic profile information (e.g., name, email address)
- Google Drive files or metadata (if required for app functionality)
- Calendar events or contacts (if applicable)
- Any other internally relevant.

No sensitive scopes are used unless explicitly required for functionality and only with user consent.

## 3. How We Use Information
User data is used solely for the purpose of enabling core functionality of the app. Examples include:

- Identifying authorized users
- Accessing or modifying content (e.g., files or events) the user explicitly interacts with
- Improving the usability of internal workflows

We do not use this information for advertising, user profiling, or sharing with third parties.

## 4. Data Storage and Security
We take reasonable steps to protect the data accessed by this application:

- Data is only accessed when necessary and only by authenticated users
- No user data is stored persistently unless required for internal processing, and such data is secured using industry best practices
- Access is restricted to internal team members via secure authentication mechanisms

## 5. Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or disclose user data to any third parties. All data remains internal and is used solely for team purposes.

## 6. User Control and Consent
Since this is a private, internal app:

- Only authorized team members are granted access
- Access to any Google API scopes is requested with explicit user consent
- Users may revoke access at any time through their Google account settings
